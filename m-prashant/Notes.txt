terraform init --> Initialize Terraform in the directory
terraform plan ---> Shows changes required by the current configuration
terraform apply --> Apply the changes
terraform destroy --> Destory the recent changes
terraform validate --> Validates the configuration files


variables:
   variable "region" {
    description = "The AWS Region to create resources in"
    type = " "
    default = "us-east-1"
   }


   Outputs:
     output "name" {
  value = output value
}



Random Provider:
The "random" provider allows the use of randomness within Terraform configurations. This is a logical provider, which means that it works entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other services.
random = {
      source = "hashicorp/random"
      version = "3.6.3"
      }


Terraform Remote State Management
 -> Create s3 bucket
 -> Backend block for remote state Management
 terraform {
  backend "s3" or "dynamodb" or etc...{
  bucket = "bucket-name"
  key = "path to trafform.tfstate"
  region = "ap-south-1"
  }
 }


 Data Sources in Terraform"
 It allows you to fetch and use information form:-
    1. external sources or
    2. existing resources within your cloud infrastructure

    Useful for obtaining dyanmic data that you need for your configuration

    Data Source: aws_ami
Use this data source to get the ID of a registered AMI for use in other resources.

data "aws_ami" "example" {
  executable_users = ["self"]
  most_recent      = true
  name_regex       = "^myami-[0-9]{3}"
  owners           = ["self"]

  filter {
    name   = "name"
    values = ["myami-*"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "root-device-type"
    values = ["ebs"]
  }

  filter {
    name   = "virtualization-type"
    values = ["hvm"]
  }
}


Terraform variables: presedence (low to high below list)
4.environment var
3.terraform.tfvars  -> More presedence than variable.tf and environment var
2.*.auto.rfvars
1.-var & -var-file  --> we allocate variable file 

Terraform Local Values:A local value assigns a name to an expression, so you can use the name multiple times within a module instead of repeating the expression. Local values are like a function's temporary local variables.

$env:TF_VAR_aws_instance_type = "t2.micro" --> Set environment variable in windows powershell


Limitation:
variable "aws_instance_type" {
  description = "What type of instance you want to create?"
  type        = string
  validation {   #-->Set limitation
    condition = var.aws_instance_type=="t2.micro" || var.aws_instance_type=="t3.micro"
    error_message = "Only t2 and t3 micro allowed"
  }
}


Terraform Operators and Expression:
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
locals {
  a = 5
  b = 2
  sum = a + b        # Addition
  difference = a - b # Subtraction
  product = a * b    # Multiplication
  quotient = a / b   # Division
  modulo = a % b     # Modulo
}

# 2. Comparison Operators
locals {
  equal = a == b           # Equal to
  not_equal = a != b       # Not equal to
  greater_than = a > b     # Greater than
  less_than = a < b        # Less than
  greater_or_equal = a >= b # Greater than or equal to
  less_or_equal = a <= b   # Less than or equal to
}

# 3. Logical Operators
locals {
  and = a > 0 && b < 10   # Logical AND
  or = a < 0 || b > 10    # Logical OR
  not = !(a == b)         # Logical NOT
}

# 4. Conditional Expressions
locals {
  result = a > b ? "a is greater" : "b is greater or equal"
}

# 5. String Interpolation
locals {
  name = "John"
  greeting = "Hello, ${name}!"
}

# 6. For Expressions
locals {
  list = ["a", "b", "c"]
  upper_list = [for item in list : upper(item)]
}

# 7. Splat Expressions
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = 3
  # other configurations...
}

output "instance_ids" {
  value = aws_instance.example[*].id
}

# 8. Dynamic Blocks
resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name = "example"
  dynamic "ingress" {
    for_each = var.service_ports
    content {
      from_port = ingress.value
      to_port   = ingress.value
      protocol  = "tcp"
    }
  }
}

# 9. Map and Lookup
variable "instance_types" {
  default = {
    "dev"  = "t2.micro"
    "prod" = "t2.large"
  }
}

locals {
  env = "dev"
  instance_type = lookup(var.instance_types, local.env, "t2.medium")
}

# 10. Coalesce Function
locals {
  default_name = "default"
  actual_name = coalesce(var.custom_name, local.default_name)
}


Terraform Functions:
-->Built-in functions that you can call from within expressions to transform and combine values

ex: max(5,12,9)

  value = upper(local.value)
  value = startswith(local.value, "Hello")
  value = split(" ", local.value)
  value = min(1,2,3,4,5)
  value = abs(-15)
  value = length(var.string_list)  #-->Length of the string
  value = join(":", var.string_list)
  value = contains(var.string_list, "Serv1") #-->Contains the value or not
  value = toset(var.string_list) #-->Remove duplicate



  Terraform Multi-Resources 
  1.Count
  2. for_each  

1.Count --> Count is a simple way to create multiple instances of a resource. It's useful when you need to create a specific number of identical or nearly identical resources.

Example:
resource "aws_instance" "server" {
  count = 3
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  tags = {
    Name = "Server ${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
This creates 3 EC2 instances, each with a unique tag name.

2.for_each --> for_each is more versatile than count. It allows you to create multiple resources based on a map or set of strings, giving you more control over the created resources.

Example using a Map:
variable "users" {
  type = map(object({
    role = string
    is_admin = bool
  }))
  default = {
    alice = { role = "developer", is_admin = false }
    bob   = { role = "manager", is_admin = true }
    carol = { role = "developer", is_admin = false }
  }
}

resource "aws_iam_user" "example" {
  for_each = var.users
  name     = each.key
  tags = {
    Role    = each.value.role
    IsAdmin = each.value.is_admin
  }
}

Example using a set of strings:

variable "subnet_cidr_blocks" {
  type    = set(string)
  default = ["10.0.1.0/24", "10.0.2.0/24", "10.0.3.0/24"]
}

resource "aws_subnet" "example" {
  for_each          = var.subnet_cidr_blocks
  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.main.id
  cidr_block        = each.value
  availability_zone = "us-west-2a"
}



Terraform Moudles:
Terraform modules are containers for multiple resources that are used together. A module consists of collection of 
.tf and/or .tf.json files kept together in a directory. Modules are the main way to package and reuse resource configurations with Terraform.

Module Structure:
module_name/
│
├── main.tf         # Main configuration files
├── variables.tf    # Input variables
├── outputs.tf      # Output values
└── README.md       # Documentation  


Resource Lifecycle -- resource creation to destruction

resource "aws_instance" "example" {

ami = "ami-123456"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
lifecycle {

create_before_destroy = true

}

}
1.prevent_destroy
2.ignore_changes:
resource "aws_iam_user_login_profile" "profile" {

for_each = aws_iam_user.users
user = each.value.name
password_length = 12

lifecycle {

ignore_changes = [

password_length,
password_reset_required,
pgp_key,

  ]
 }
}
3.replace_triggerred_by


 
Pre and Post - conditions - Resource validation --> Allows you to define checks that must be true before resource is created (precondition) and after a resource is created (postcondition)

-->precondition:

lifecycle {
  precondition{
    condition = var.bucket_name != ""
    error_message = "The bucket name must not empty."
  }
}

-->postcondition:

lifecycle {
  postcondition{
    condition =  aws_s3_bucket.example.arn != ""
    error_message "The bucket ARN must not be empty after creation"
  }
}


State Manipulation

Subcommands:
    list                List resources in the state
    mv                  Move an item in the state or rename
    pull                Pull current state and output to stdout
    push                Update remote state from a local state file
    replace-provider    Replace provider in the state
    rm                  Remove instances from the state
    show                Show detail information of a resource in the state

  terraform state rm <resourcename> --> terraform will not manage the resource anymore

• List all resources in the state: terraform state list

• Show details of a specific resource: terraform state show <resource_address>

• Move a resource to a different address: terraform state mv <source_address> <destination_address>

• Remove a resource from the state: terraform state rm <resource_address>

• Pull the current state: terraform state pull

• Push a local state file to the remote backend: terraform state push <state_file>

• List all state commands: terraform state


Terraform Import: Allows you to Import existing infrastructure resources into your Terraform state.

Use Case:
1.Assuming you have already created an Ec2 instance.
2.Create a resource block in tf config (initially you can keep it empty)
3.Use terraform import command 
   terraform import aws_instance.main ec2_id
4.Terraform show to inspect the imported resource
5.Update the resource block accordingly



Terraform CLI Workspace --> Allows you to manage multiple sets of infrastructure configurations within a single configuration directory. Each workspace has its own state file  

• Listing Workspaces --> terraform workspace list

• Creating a Workspace --> terraform workspace new <workspace_name>

• Selecting a Workspace --> terraform workspace select <workspace_name>

• Showing the Current Workspace --> terraform workspace show

• Deleting a Workspace
  >terraform workspace select default
  >terraform workspace delete <workspace_name>
